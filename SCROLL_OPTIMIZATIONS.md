# Scrolling Behavior & Spacing Optimizations

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Excessive Spacing Issues

- **Hero Section**: Reduced `min-h-screen` to `min-h-[80vh]` to prevent excessive height
- **Padding**: Changed `py-20` to `py-12` across all components
- **Margins**: Reduced `mb-16` to `mb-10`, `mt-16` to `mt-10`, `mb-20` to `mb-12`
- **Grid Gaps**: Optimized gap spacing from `gap-8` to `gap-6` where appropriate

### 2. Scroll Behavior Conflicts

- **CSS Smooth Scroll**: Disabled native `scroll-behavior: smooth` to prevent conflicts with GSAP
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: Optimized configuration with better performance settings
- **Custom Smooth Scroll**: Created `useSmoothScroll` hook for better control over scroll behavior

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **GSAP Animations**: Simplified and reduced animation complexity
- **Lazy Loading**: Improved intersection observer settings (`threshold: 0.2`, `rootMargin: 50px`)
- **Layout Shifts**: Reduced skeleton heights to match actual content better
- **Scroll Triggers**: Set most animations to `once: true` to prevent re-triggering

### 4. Layout Improvements

- **Overflow Control**: Added `overflow-x-hidden` to body to prevent horizontal scrolling
- **Scroll Padding**: Added `scroll-padding-top: 80px` for anchor link navigation
- **Section Spacing**: Added `scroll-mt-20` classes for better section separation

## Components Updated

### Major Updates:

- `hero.tsx`: Reduced height and spacing
- `features.tsx`: Optimized padding and margins
- `investor-table.tsx`: Reduced section spacing
- `testimonials-marquee.tsx`: Minimized vertical spacing
- `lazy-section.tsx`: Improved intersection observer logic

### Hooks Created/Updated:

- `use-gsap-scroll.ts`: Simplified and optimized GSAP animations
- `use-smooth-scroll.ts`: New custom smooth scroll implementation

### CSS Updates:

- `globals.css`: Disabled native smooth scroll, added scroll padding

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Animation Complexity**: Simplified GSAP animations for better performance
2. **Optimized ScrollTrigger**: Better configuration for mobile and desktop
3. **Lazy Loading**: More aggressive intersection observer settings
4. **Layout Stability**: Reduced spacing to minimize layout shifts

## Expected Results

- ✅ Smoother scrolling behavior without conflicts
- ✅ Significantly reduced white space and unused space
- ✅ Better content rendering and layout stability
- ✅ Improved mobile performance
- ✅ More compact and focused design

## Test Instructions

1. Navigate through the page and observe smoother scrolling
2. Check that content renders properly without excessive gaps
3. Verify animations trigger correctly without conflicts
4. Test on mobile devices for improved performance
5. Verify anchor link navigation works smoothly
