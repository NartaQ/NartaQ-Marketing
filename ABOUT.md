# NartaQ — A focused ecosystem for the France–Tunisia corridor

Mission: Bridge Tunisia’s exceptional technical talent with global capital and market opportunities through a trust‑driven platform.

Note: Deeper implementation details (matching logic, compliance workflows, and payment mechanics) are shared under NDA at this pre‑seed stage.

## What we do

NartaQ operates on two complementary axes, with an orchestration layer that ties them together:

1) Startups ↔ Investors (dealflow)
- AI‑assisted deck quality checks and rubric‑based scoring
- Curated, tracked intros; optional NDA‑gated data access
- Progress tracking from term sheet → diligence → close

2) Service Providers ↔ Companies (work)
- Verified profiles and corridor‑aware matching (skills, language, rate bands)
- Brief intake, shortlist workflows, and milestone contracting
- Delivery tracking with acceptance criteria and audit trails

Bridging the axes (orchestration)
- Turn funding into delivery: define scopes, milestones, and acceptance tests; assign SPs
- Milestone protections and staged releases; optional hybrid compensation (cash + equity/options)
- Optional intermediation: coordination, milestone verification, and dispute handling

## Why this corridor
- Deep Franco‑Tunisian ties and French‑language fluency
- High‑caliber engineering talent with favorable cost structures
- EU‑friendly time zones and data residency options

## Trust and compliance
- KYC/KYB, credential checks, and structured references
- NDA‑gated access, RBAC, and audit logs for sensitive materials
- GDPR‑aligned data handling in EU regions; encryption in transit/at rest
- Bounty‑specific controls: immutable briefs, acceptance templates, timestamped submissions, and private bounty mode

## Bounty micro‑tasks (Axis 2)
- Scoped briefs with acceptance criteria and budget ranges
- First‑acceptable vs shortlist‑then‑award modes; timeboxed acceptance windows
- Payout on acceptance; optional multi‑milestone payouts; IP handled in terms

## Business model (high‑level)
- Startups ↔ Investors: credit‑based submissions; optional premium analytics/visibility
- Service Providers ↔ Companies: freemium profiles; priority listing/matching for premium and enterprise
- Orchestration and bounties: transactional and service fees where applicable

## Why now
- Policy tailwinds and sovereign tech priorities
- Remote‑first norms and persistent talent shortages
- Corridor momentum with visible success stories
