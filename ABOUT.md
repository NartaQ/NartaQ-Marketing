# NartaQ — The Collective Intelligence Deal Engine for France–Tunisia

**Mission**: Bridge Tunisia's exceptional technical talent with global capital through a community-owned, DAO-governed dealflow platform designed for elite investors and exceptional startups.

**Positioning**: An Elite network where elite investors co-source and vet exceptional Tunisian tech talent through a shared, community-owned platform. Think "OpenVC meets DAO governance" for the strategic France-Tunisia corridor.

*Note: Deeper implementation details (AI matching algorithms, DAO governance mechanics, and token economics) are shared under NDA at this pre-seed stage.*

## What we do

NartaQ operates as a decentralized, community-owned dealflow platform with a focused mission: solve the investor-startup matching problem in the France-Tunisia corridor through collective intelligence.

### Core Product: AI-Powered Dealflow Platform
- **The Sourcing DAO**: Network of investors and ecosystem partners actively refers and scouts deals, earning rewards for quality submissions
- **The Vetting Stack**: AI screens for fit, then expert reviewer network (including active VCs) provides structured, actionable feedback  
- **The Trust Layer**: Every startup is verified. Key data—from cap tables to technical audits—is attested on-chain for immutable due diligence
- **Shared Success Model**: Token holders govern the platform, vote on features, participate in due diligence, and share in platform success

### The DAO Advantage: Our Key Differentiator
- **Submit & Earn**: Quality deal submissions earn reputation points or governance tokens
- **Review & Govern**: Token holders participate in due diligence rounds and vote on platform evolution
- **Share in Value**: Community shares in platform success through aligned economic model
- **Collective Intelligence**: Leverage combined expertise of investor community for superior deal evaluation

### Future Vision: Phase 2 Expansion
Once we own the capital-talent connection, we can orchestrate the execution of that capital by helping funded startups connect with vetted service providers and technical talent—a natural, high-value extension built on our dealflow foundation.
