### SPV Partner Integration: Streamlined Deal Syndication

NartaQ partners with leading SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) providers to enable seamless deal syndication and investor pooling for matched opportunities.

#### How SPV Partnerships Work

1. **Deal Qualification**: Once a founder-investor match shows strong mutual interest, we facilitate SPV formation for broader syndication
2. **SPV Partner Selection**: We connect matched parties with pre-vetted SPV providers specializing in France-Tunisia cross-border deals
3. **Automated Setup**: SPV partners handle entity formation, compliance, legal documentation, and investor onboarding
4. **Capital Pooling**: Enable multiple investors to co-invest through a single legal vehicle, reducing administrative overhead
5. **Ongoing Management**: SPV partners manage cap table administration, reporting, and governance throughout investment lifecycle

#### SPV Partner Workflows

**For Lead Investors**:

- Initiate SPV formation after successful match with founder
- Define investment terms, ticket size, and syndicate structure
- Invite co-investors from NartaQ platform or external networks

**For Co-Investors (Angels & Small Funds)**:

- Receive syndicate invitations from lead investors on platform
- Review deal terms, founder profile, and investment thesis
- Commit capital with minimal paperwork through SPV partner portal

**For Founders**:

- Single point of contact for syndicated investment vs. managing multiple investor relationships
