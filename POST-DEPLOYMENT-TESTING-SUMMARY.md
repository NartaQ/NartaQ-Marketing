- ✅ App routes accessibility checks
- ✅ Static assets availability verification

### 2. Smoke Test Script (`scripts/smoke-tests.ts`)
- ✅ Newsletter subscription functionality
- ✅ Form validation testing
- ✅ Duplicate prevention mechanisms
- ✅ Database queries and transactions
- ✅ Prisma Client generation verification

### 3. Comprehensive Test Runner (`scripts/post-deployment-tests.ts`)
- ✅ Combines health checks and smoke tests
- ✅ Detailed reporting with timing
- ✅ CI/CD integration ready
- ✅ Error handling and recommendations

## Package.json Scripts Added

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:health": "tsx scripts/health-check.ts",
    "test:smoke": "tsx scripts/smoke-tests.ts", 
    "test:post-deployment": "tsx scripts/post-deployment-tests.ts"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run health checks only
npm run test:health

# Run smoke tests only (requires app running)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run test:smoke

# Run comprehensive post-deployment tests
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com npm run test:post-deployment
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Add to your deployment pipeline
- name: Post-Deployment Verification
  run: npm run test:post-deployment
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}
```
